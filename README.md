# Introduction

This repository accompanies “Inequalities in life expectancy by educational percentiles: a review of methods and approaches.”
An open-access link to the paper will be added here once available.
The replication files are implemented in the R statistical programming language.

We review methodological and conceptual approaches to measuring educational inequalities in life expectancy using percentiles rather than coarse attainment categories. A Chilean case study demonstrates how different choices shape the resulting estimates and their comparability over time and across populations.

# Prerequisites

As a pre-requisite to running this locally, you will need a working installation of R with all of the necessary dependencies installed.

# Structure

- Data_folder relates to: input source data
- Scripts relates to: code to replicate data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- Out relates to: output data
- Figures relates to: output figures 

# Data availability

The empirical application uses Chilean mortality and education data. The repository provides scripted pipelines and functions to reproduce the analyses with authorized inputs.

# Versioning

This repository hosts the pre-publication version of the code (v0.1.0). Please report bugs, request features, or share suggestions by opening an issue, or contact the corresponding author(s) via email.
